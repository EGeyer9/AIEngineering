    <h2><i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> Boosting Engineering Efficiency with AI</h2>
    <p>AI is revolutionizing efficiency across all disciplines. From real-time condition monitoring to predictive maintenance, AI enables faster decisions and reduced waste.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Mechanical Engineering:</strong> AI speeds up prototyping through digital twins and optimization algorithms.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-city"></i> Civil Engineering:</strong> Smart simulations predict traffic flow, structural response, and material fatigue.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-warehouse"></i> Industrial Engineering:</strong> Intelligent systems balance production lines, allocate resources, and cut downtime.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> Electrical Engineering:</strong> AI forecasts power demand and enhances energy storage efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With AI analyzing real-time sensor data and automating routine calculations, engineers spend less time troubleshooting and more time innovating. Products are delivered faster, safer, and with fewer defects, allowing industries to scale sustainably.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="creativity" class="info-page section hidden">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Amplifying Creativity with AI</h2>
    <p>AI doesn't just automate — it liberates engineers to explore their creative side. By automating tedious, repetitive, and complex calculations, AI frees engineers to focus on human ingenuity, aesthetics, and novel designs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Creative Focus:</strong> Engineers use time saved from calculations to brainstorm unconventional ideas and take creative risks.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-magic"></i> Generative Tools:</strong> AI helps visualize hundreds of iterations at once, letting engineers pick the most innovative or aesthetic solution.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Rapid Prototyping:</strong> Software engineers now use AI to prototype apps and interactions in minutes instead of days.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i> Biomedical Innovation:</strong> AI helps invent devices that adapt to unique human conditions, like gait or speech, expanding both creativity and impact.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Creativity is no longer reserved for artists. Engineers now build bridges that inspire, design robots with personality, and develop user experiences that feel magical. AI doesn’t replace imagination — it powers it.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="human" class="info-page section hidden">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-scale-balanced"></i> Human Responsibility in the Age of AI</h2>
    <p>As AI becomes more capable, the responsibility to guide its use lies squarely with people. Engineers, leaders, and society must ensure AI is used ethically, safely, and for the common good.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Ethical Use:</strong> AI needs human guidance to avoid reinforcing bias, misinformation, or discrimination.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check"></i> Regulation:</strong> Policies and legal standards must evolve to ensure transparency, privacy, and accountability in AI systems.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-users-cog"></i> Education & Training:</strong> Engineers must be trained to understand both the power and the risks of AI technologies.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-people-arrows"></i> Human-AI Collaboration:</strong> AI works best when paired with human judgment, empathy, and creativity.</li>
      <li><strong><i class="fas fa-handshake-angle"></i> Social Impact:</strong> Engineers must use AI to reduce inequality, improve access, and uplift underserved communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI may be powerful, but it is not wise — humans must be the stewards of its purpose. It’s our responsibility to ensure AI builds a more just, thoughtful, and human-centered future.</p>
