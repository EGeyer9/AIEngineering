      <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Efficiency</h3>
      <p>AI streamlines engineering tasks, automating repetitive calculations and simulations. This saves time, allowing engineers to focus on higher-level problem-solving. Automated systems can handle tasks such as optimizing designs, reducing trial-and-error in simulations, and processing large datasets quickly, which accelerates the development process and improves accuracy.</p>

    <section id="creativity" class="content hidden">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Creativity</h3>
      <p>AI empowers engineers by freeing them from mundane tasks, allowing for more time to focus on innovation. For instance, AI tools can suggest alternative design ideas, explore new materials, or predict unforeseen problems, enabling engineers to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in fields such as robotics, renewable energy, and aerospace technology.</p>

    <section id="human-centered" class="content hidden">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Human-Centered Engineering</h3>
      <p>AI enables engineers to create products and systems that are more responsive to human needs. In biomedical engineering, for example, AI is used to design prosthetics that adapt to individual movement patterns. In automotive engineering, AI improves safety features by predicting human driver behavior and adjusting vehicle responses accordingly, ultimately creating a better user experience.</p>
