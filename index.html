      <h2><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> Boosting Efficiency</h2>
      <p>AI is transforming engineering by streamlining processes that were previously time-consuming and tedious. Tasks such as simulations, modeling, and debugging can now be automated or accelerated, saving engineers vast amounts of time and resources. This newfound efficiency allows for quicker iteration and faster product development cycles. Engineers can now experiment with multiple versions of a design, optimizing every aspect without wasting valuable resources.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Faster Prototyping:</strong> Engineers use AI-driven simulations to test prototypes in virtual environments, eliminating the need for costly physical prototypes in many cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI can analyze data and predict issues before they happen, allowing for preemptive action that improves efficiency and prevents costly downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Scheduling:</strong> AI systems automatically generate the most efficient production schedules, factoring in machine downtime, material availability, and workforce optimization.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- PAGE 3: AI & CREATIVITY -->
  <main id="creativity" class="page hidden">
    <section class="section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Unleashing Creativity</h2>
      <p>AI isn’t just about automation — it also helps engineers tap into their creative potential. AI can analyze existing solutions, uncover patterns, and propose new, unconventional ideas. By combining human intuition and creative problem-solving with AI's data-driven insights, engineers can push the boundaries of what’s possible, creating innovative products and solutions that were previously unimaginable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Generative Design:</strong> AI algorithms generate multiple design alternatives based on a set of input parameters. Engineers can explore various configurations and choose the one that best meets their objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>New Material Discovery:</strong> AI helps materials engineers identify innovative materials with superior properties for use in fields like aerospace, healthcare, and electronics.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Enhanced Prototyping:</strong> AI can optimize prototypes not just for functionality, but for aesthetic appeal and design elegance, expanding creative possibilities.</li>
