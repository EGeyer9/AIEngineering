      <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Efficiency</h3>
      <p>AI allows engineers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, making their workflow more efficient. For instance, complex simulations and optimization processes can be automated with AI, reducing the time needed for manual calculations. This accelerates design iterations, helps meet tight deadlines, and maximizes resource allocation. With AI-powered tools, engineers can make more informed decisions quickly, allowing for faster production and innovation.</p>

    <section id="creativity" class="content hidden">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Creativity</h3>
      <p>With AI handling tedious tasks, engineers can focus on the more creative aspects of their work. AI empowers engineers to experiment with different designs and concepts, simulate multiple iterations in seconds, and even visualize outcomes. This gives engineers the freedom to explore new ideas without the constraints of time-consuming manual tasks. Whether it's designing futuristic vehicles or cutting-edge biomedical devices, AI provides engineers with more time to innovate and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.</p>

    <section id="human-centered" class="content hidden">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Human-Centered Engineering</h3>
      <p>AI enhances the human side of engineering by allowing engineers to focus on human needs and societal impacts. With AI handling data analysis and optimization, engineers can prioritize user experience, safety, and accessibility. For example, AI can simulate real-world scenarios to ensure that products are safe and user-friendly. In healthcare, AI helps create personalized prosthetics by analyzing patient data, ensuring that human needs remain at the core of every design. AI supports engineers in building technologies that truly benefit society.</p>
