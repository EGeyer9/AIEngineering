    <h2><i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> Boosting Engineering Efficiency with AI</h2>
    <p>AI is revolutionizing efficiency across all fields of engineering. From real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance to generative design and autonomous control systems, the integration of AI leads to smarter, faster decision-making and less wasted resources.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mechanical Engineering:</strong> AI speeds up the prototyping process using digital twins and topology optimization.</li>
      <li><strong>Civil Engineering:</strong> AI-powered traffic simulations reduce congestion and environmental impact in smart cities.</li>
      <li><strong>Industrial Engineering:</strong> AI tools optimize production schedules, minimizing downtime and maximizing throughput.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When machines learn from data and adapt autonomously, engineers can focus on innovation instead of repetitive optimization. The result? Projects delivered faster, cheaper, and with higher quality.</p>

  <section id="creativity" class="info-page">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Amplifying Creativity with AI</h2>
    <p>AI isn't just about efficiency—it's a creativity partner. Engineers are now using AI to push the boundaries of design, discover unseen solutions, and solve problems in ways previously unimaginable.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Generative Design:</strong> AI algorithms generate thousands of design alternatives, helping mechanical engineers create lightweight yet strong structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Architecture and Civil Engineering:</strong> AI helps simulate not only structural strength but also aesthetic harmony and pedestrian comfort.</li>
      <li><strong>Biomedical Engineering:</strong> AI aids in personalizing prosthetics and medical devices based on user-specific biometrics and behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With AI as a tool, engineers become not just builders—but artists, futurists, and inventors capable of dreaming bigger and building bolder.</p>

  <section id="human" class="info-page">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i> The Human Side of Engineering in the Age of AI</h2>
    <p>As AI takes on more technical and repetitive tasks, the uniquely human aspects of engineering become even more important. Empathy, ethics, communication, and interdisciplinary thinking are now at the forefront.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ethical Design:</strong> Engineers must guide AI systems with ethical considerations, avoiding bias, and ensuring fairness.</li>
      <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> Mechanical and biomedical engineers must ensure that products enhance the user experience—not just technically succeed.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Teamwork, leadership, and the ability to communicate across disciplines are more vital than ever.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Engineers today aren't just solving equations—they're shaping the social, ethical, and cultural impact of technology. And that makes the human side of engineering not just relevant, but essential.</p>
