      <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Efficiency</h3>
      <p>AI enables engineers to automate tedious and repetitive tasks, significantly improving workflow. For example, AI algorithms can be used to optimize designs, automate simulations, and reduce the time required for calculations, freeing up time for engineers to focus on innovation. This speeds up the design and development process, allowing companies to meet deadlines and maximize production efficiency while ensuring accuracy and quality.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="creativity" class="content hidden">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Creativity</h3>
      <p>By handling repetitive tasks, AI gives engineers more time to engage in creative problem-solving and exploration. In industries like automotive, aerospace, and biomedical engineering, AI allows engineers to try out multiple design iterations quickly, providing new insights and possibilities that may not have been feasible without AI. This fosters an environment of innovation and experimentation, allowing engineers to break new ground in product design and technology.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="human-centered" class="content hidden">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Human-Centered Engineering</h3>
      <p>AI helps engineers design technologies that are centered around human needs. In fields like healthcare, AI can be used to create customized prosthetics that adapt to a patientâ€™s movement patterns. In automotive engineering, AI ensures that self-driving cars are designed with safety and user experience in mind. AI reduces the risk of human error, allows for more accurate predictions, and enables engineers to create safer, more effective products that improve the quality of life for people around the world.</p>
